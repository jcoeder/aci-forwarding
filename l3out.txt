The access policies for external Layer 3 connection include the following:
A L3 domain references a VLAN pool, which serves the external Layer 3 connections.
An attachable access entity profile (AAEP) references a domain, such as the L3 domain, and therefore specifies the VLAN pool that can be activated on an interface.
An interface policy defines a protocol or interface properties that are applied to interfaces. These policies have already been configured.
An interface policy group gathers multiple interface policies into one set and binds them to an AAEP. You will use the existing ExtL3_IPG group.
The interface selector identifies the interface (or interface block) for the L3Out and associates it with the interface policy group. Ethernet 1/4 connects leaf-a to the Nexus switch, your external Layer 3 device for the BGP_L3Out.
An interface profile groups one or more interface selectors, effectively specifying the policies consumed by the interface blocks. An appropriate interface profile (LEAF101_IFP) has already been configured.
A switch profile chooses one or more leaf switches and associates them with an interface profile, effectively specifying the policies consumed by the interface blocks on a given switch. An appropriate interface profile (LEAF101_SWP) has already been configured.
