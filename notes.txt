Local and remote enpoints are learned via the data plane

Remote endpoints are a cache

Each leaf is responsible for reporting its local endpoingts to the COOP database

ACI will function without remote endpoint learning but remote endpoing learning allows for contracts to be applied sooner and reduce flooding by contacting COOP database first.

With ARP flooding enabled - ARP requests are flooded across the fabric.  All leafs will learn the remote endpoint.

Tunnel interfaces are built based on remote endpoints
